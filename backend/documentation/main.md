## **Trading Simulator**

### Overview

The **Trading Simulator** is a stateless execution engine designed to simulate the execution of trading orders against historical market data. It is exposed as a REST API and accepts structured trade instructions (orders) as input. It returns detailed execution results and performance metrics.

The simulator does **not** perform any signal generation or strategy logic ‚Äî it solely focuses on **deterministic execution and evaluation** of submitted orders.

---

### Core Use Cases

- Backtest pre-generated orders against historical OHLCV data
    
- Benchmark strategies in a consistent and repeatable simulation environment
    
- Integrate with internal strategy labs or external users via API

### üß† Key Concepts

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Order**|A structured instruction to enter a trade at a specific time and price, with associated stop loss and take profit levels|
|**Execution**|The act of simulating how the order would have been filled based on historical candle data|
|**Timeframe**|Candle interval used for simulation (e.g., 15m, 1h)|
|**Execution Window**|Time period over which the simulator will attempt to execute the orders|
|**Fill Logic**|Deterministic rule set to simulate MKT or LMT order fills, including SL/TP triggers|

## üì• Order Schema (Input)

```json
{
  "symbol": "AAPL",
  "timeframe": "15m",

    {
      "entry_time": "2024-05-10T14:00:00Z",
      "entry_type": "LMT",           // or "MKT"
      "entry_price": 185.50,         // ignored for MKT
      "side": "buy",                 // or "sell"
      "stop_loss": 182.00,
      "take_profit": 190.00
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

## üîÑ Fill Logic (Execution Model)

|Order Type|Fill Rule|
|---|---|
|**MKT**|Entry filled at the open price of `entry_time` bar|
|**LMT**|Entry fills if price touches `entry_price` during or after `entry_time`|
|**TP / SL**|Evaluated once position is open, in candle order. First touch wins (unless you model more complex intra-candle logic)|
|**Unfilled Orders**|Discarded if entry conditions are never met within the simulation window|

---

## üöÄ API Design

### `POST /simulate`

**Request:**

- Accepts JSON as per order schema
    

**Response:**

- Returns structured execution results (as above)
    

**Example Curl:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/simulate \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @orders.json
```
